                                Lucy is a Great Pyrenees dog.
                                The Great Pyrenees breed is a
                                Livestock Guardian Dog (LGD) typically
                                guarding sheep on a farm from hungry wolves.

                                Lucy was adopted through For the Love Of Dogs, Vermont in August of 2018.
                                She was a rescue from Mississippi found in a high kill shelter. She was two
                                years old at the time, and was terribly underweight. Having just weened her
                                puppies, she was only 68 pounds. Close to six years later, she is currently
                                135 pounds living in Wakefield, New Hampshire with her Mom, Keira. Lucy loves
                                the snow, which is why New Hampsire is the perfect place for this floof.

                                protecting her humans from a sure death by stabbing

                                mountaintops. Pyrs today are mellow

                                home and family. Frequently described

                                strong mountain dogs standing as high as

                                tipping the scales at more than 100 pounds.
                                These steadfast guardians usually exhibit
                                a Zen-like calm, but they can quickly s

                                Often, dogs need some time to adjust, unwind and relax before
                                they find their FURever home.

                                By registering as a Foster to rescue dogs, you are helping

                                The Foster's job is to introduce dogs to learning family living,
                                what it's like to be just a dog. A family member. Fosters help
                                dogs understand that all people aren't bad, but loving and friendly.

                                Fosters must be 18 years or older, be willing and able to take
