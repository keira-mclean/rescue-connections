                        Lucy is a Great Pyrenees dog.  
                        The Great Pyrenees breed is a 
                        Livestock Guardian Dog (LGD) typically
                        guarding sheep on a farm from hungry wolves.

                    <p>
                        Lucy was adopted through For the Love Of Dogs, Vermont in August of 2018.
                        She was a rescue from Mississippi found in a high kill shelter.  She was two 
                        years old at the time, and was terribly underweight.  Having just weened her 
                        puppies, she was only 68 pounds.  Close to six years later, she is currently 
                        135 pounds living in Wakefield, New Hampshire with her Mom, Keira.

                    <h3>The Breed Standard</h3>
                    <h4>Breed Standard:</h4>
                    <p>The Great Pyrenees is a large, 
                        thickly coated, and immensely powerful 
                        working dog bred to deter sheep-stealing 
                        wolves and other predators on snowy 
                        mountaintops. Pyrs today are mellow 
                        companions and vigilant guardians of 
                        home and family. Frequently described 
                        as 'majestic,'¬ù Pyrs are big, immensely 
                        strong mountain dogs standing as high as 
                        32 inches at the shoulder and often 
                        tipping the scales at more than 100 pounds.
                         These steadfast guardians usually exhibit 
                         a Zen-like calm, but they can quickly s
                         pring into action and move with grace 
                         and speed to meet a threat. The lush 
                         weatherproof coat is all white, or 
                         white with markings of beautiful 
                         shades of gray, tan, reddish-brown, 
                         or badger.</p>

                    <p>Lucy enjoys her large fenced in back yard.  
                        Most of the time, you can find Lucy barking at the
                        ninja's that the human eye can't see in the woods,
                        protecting her humans from a sure death by stabbing
                        by the invisible ninja's.

                    <p>She enjoys lounging in the house, the couch is entirely hers.
                        Afterall, it is her house and visitors are just that, visiting.
